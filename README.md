# kotlin-lzfse-decode
[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/radar-base/org.radarbase/lzfse-decode/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/radar-base/org.radarbase/lzfse-decode/_latestVersion)

A Kotlin [LZFSE](https://github.com/lzfse/lzfse) capable decoder. This code base is a Kotlin adaptation of the [RagingMoose](https://github.com/horrorho/RagingMoose) Java LZFSE decoder, with some small optimizations applied. That codebase has been designed from the ground up as and barring constants/ tables and a few core routines, has little in the way of resemblance to the source material.

## Should I use it?

The raison d'Ãªtre of kotlin-lzfse-decode is it's ease of integration into Java projects without the use of external dependencies/ interfacing.

For command line usage or increased performance on large datasets, I would suggest using the reference [lzfse](https://github.com/lzfse/lzfse) compressor.

## Usage

Create an instance of [LZFSEInputStream](https://github.com/RADAR-base/kotlin-lzfse-decode/blob/master/src/main/java/org/radarbase/io/lzfse/LZFSEInputStream.kt) and consume/ close as an [InputStream](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html).

The constructor accepts a [ReadableByteChannel](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/channels/ReadableByteChannel.html) or an InputStream.

A simple example that decodes and prints the contents of an LZFSE compressed text archive. [LZFSEException](https://github.com/RADAR-base/kotlin-lzfse-decode/blob/master/src/main/java/org/radarbase/io/lzfse/LZFSEException.kt)s signify errors in the underlying data format.

Below is a Kotlin example:

```kotlin
try {
    Files.newByteChannel(Paths.get("my.lzfse.compressed.text.file")).use { channel ->
        val data = LZFSEInputStream(channel).use { it.readAllBytes() }
        println(data.toString(Charsets.UTF_8))
    }
} catch (ex: LZFSEException) {
    println("Bad LZFSE archive: $path")
} catch (ex: IOException) {
    println("IOException: $ex")
}
```

And here is a Java example:

```java
Path path = Paths.get("my.lzfse.compressed.text.file"); // your LZFSE compressed text file here

byte[] buffer = new byte[4096];
try (LZFSEInputStream is = new LZFSEInputStream(Files.newByteChannel(path));
        ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream()) {
    int nRead;
    while ((nRead = is.read(buffer, 0, buffer.length)) != -1) {
        baos.write(buffer, 0, numRead);
    }
    System.out.println(baos.toString("UTF-8"));

} catch (LZFSEException ex) {
    System.err.println("Bad LZFSE archive: " + path);
} catch (IOException ex) {
    System.err.println("IOException: " + ex.toString());
}
```
